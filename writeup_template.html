<p><strong>Finding Lane Lines on the Road</strong></p>

<p>The goals / steps of this project are the following: <br>
* Make a pipeline that finds lane lines on the road <br>
* Describe the key functions </p>

<p>The input image is: <br>

<p>Followings are my pipelines.  First, image is converted into grayscale, then Gaussian smoothing is carried out as well as cannyedges, where kernel size for gaussian smoothing is 5 and the low and high thresholds for cannyedge function are 50 and 180. Second, four vertices are input for bitwise_and function, to fulfill masked edge process, which is a key process to </p>

<p>In order to draw a single line on the left and right lanes, I modified the draw_lines() function by …</p>

<p>If you’d like to include images to show how the pipeline works, here is how to include an image: </p>
